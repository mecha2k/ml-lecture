    ## Modeling the Sharpe Ratio
    # To model the Sharpe ratio as a probabilistic model, we need to priors about the distribution of returns and the
    # parameters that govern this distribution. The student t distribution exhibits fat tails relative to the normal
    # distribution for low degrees of freedom (df) and is a reasonable choice to capture this aspect of returns.

    ### Define Probability Model
    # Hence, we need to model the three parameters of this distribution, namely the mean and standard deviation of
    # returns, and the degrees of freedom. Weâ€™ll assume normal and uniform distributions for the mean and the standard
    # deviation, respectively, and an exponential distribution for the df with a sufficiently low expected value to
    # ensure fat tails. Returns are based on these probabilistic inputs, and the annualized Sharpe ratio results from
    # the standard computation, ignoring a risk-free rate (using daily returns).
